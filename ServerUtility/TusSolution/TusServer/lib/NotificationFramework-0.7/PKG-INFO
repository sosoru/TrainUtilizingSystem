Description: The Notification Framework allows one-to-many dependency between objects,
        where an object (the subject) can tell to an unknown number of objects (the
        observers) that an event occurred (typically, that the object has changed),
        without having any idea of who the observers are and where they live
        (abstract, minimal coupling).
