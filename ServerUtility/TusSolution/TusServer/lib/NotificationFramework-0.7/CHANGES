0.7 [2004/06/22]

  Now distributed under a 3-clause BSD-style license, see LICENSE for details

  - All docstrings updated for epydoc + reStructuredText

  - Added attribute __version__ to package NotificationFramework

  - Updated the files to conform to PEP-0263: source encoding is iso-8859-1

0.6.1 [2004/02/01]

  - Fixed bug #885596 reported by Thorsten Kohnhorst: import __builtin__
    missing. The initial bug report showed that the bug was triggered in
    mems_lib.isinstance(). However, the workarounds proposed in the module
    mems_lib are for python2.1 only, since the builtins isinstance() and
    issubclass() behave as expected in python2.2 and up. The module has
    been changed so that it returns the builtins for py2.2 and up.

0.6 [2003/09/28]

  - Added full support for new-style classes observers.

0.5 [2003/05/25]

  - RFE #742511 Added the ability to register multiple callbacks for an
      object, triggered by env. variable
      NOTIFICATION_CENTER_MULTIPLE_CALLBACKS_PER_OBSERVER (it is NOT enabled
      by default)

    Fixed addObserver() which did not inform the user that a single callback
      can be registered per object --> this possibly led to buggy
      behaviour. Now it raises ValueError when this happens (this could make
      existing code fails because of that --be prepared to correct this.

  - Added script tests/compare_perfs.py which calculates the performance
    penalty implied by the activation of the ability to handle multiple
    callbacks per object

  - Fixed: when generic and specific observers were registered,
      postNotification() made the list of observers grow (observers are copied
      back to the list). This slowed down the framework and a observer could
      then be notified more than once for the same notification.

  - Fixed test_Notification.py and test_NotificationCenter.py: they couldn't
    be executed as stand-alone scripts. Added tests for RFE #742511 and fixed
    bugs

    Now distributed under the GNU General Public License
    + Added MANIFEST.in

0.3.1

    - fixed a typo in NotificationCenter.postNotification()

0.3
    - changed the default behaviour of 'addObserver()': now only allows one
      and only one observer to be registered for a given
      Notification. Former behaviour is still available through the new
      parameter 'sameObserverRegistersOnce' in addObserver's signature.

    - Notification instances now caches their hash value

    - Documentation updated and augmented.

0.2
    - InstanceType are now weakly referenced

    - corrected a bug causing some observers not to be notified when an
      observer was removing it from the list of observers at reception of a
      notification
